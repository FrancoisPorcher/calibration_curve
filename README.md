# Calibration Curve

Calibration Curve is an advanced concept in machine learning that allows to improve the performance of classifier even after they have been already trained.



# 🤖 Introduction to AutoEncoders with MNIST

This is an implementation of an AutoEncoder (One linear, the other with convolutions), trained on the MNIST database

# 🎇 Demo

## AutoEncoder with Convolutions

This AutoEncoder works much better than a simple Linear AutoEncoder.
First row is the real image, second row is the reconstructed image after encoding/decoding.
